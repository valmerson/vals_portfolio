        <p>
          I'm a keen person who likes working closely to strategy and
          intelligence teams and help them to translate ideias and insights to

      <h4>
        <p>
          At the moment, you can find me working mainly with Power BI (and the
          various applications of DAX and M languages), Python and Power Point
          (the real thing, not newbies dimension) and, in general, anything
          related to SQL, QGIS, MyMaps, and some HTML and CSS tools.

      <h3><b>Personal</b></h3>
      <h4>
        <p>
          I was born in São Paulo - Brazil in the mid-90s and had a youth that
          accompanied the growth of technology. From a bachelor's degree in
          Geography at USP followed by a few years working in the world of
          research and market intelligence, I'm doing a master's degree in Data
          Journalism, Automation and DataStorytelling at Isper.

            "It was a pleasure to work with Val at Geofusion when I was in
            charge of Data Analytics Area. Always engaged and committed, he has
            the capability to zoom out and make connections between dots, in
            other words, a great panoramic sight. Considering team work, he
            plays his role always focused on combining activities, he deals with
            tasks as interdependent ones and not as single ones. Besides being a
            remarkable professional, he's a wonderful human being! I strongly
            recommend Val for any data, analytics, insights role."
